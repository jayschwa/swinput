        changed swmouse_ prefix for routines to swm_
        implemented "devs" module parameter to support multiple devices
        commented verbosity routines out again. too noisy. has been done
         already.
        fixed "direction" bug (i did in one of the last changes)
        added "log" module option to define noisyness
        added b/B options, they take 1-3 as argument to press/release
         the coressponding button. This has to be tested, yet!
        
        * swkeybd.c
        renamed to keybd.c
        
        * swinput.c
        added file for routines common to all modules
        added general logging routine
        
        * Makefile

        documented stuff
